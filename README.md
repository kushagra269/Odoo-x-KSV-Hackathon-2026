# VendorBridge — Procurement & Vendor Management ERP

A full-stack, modular Procurement ERP built from scratch for the **Odoo Hiring Hackathon**. Replaces scattered spreadsheets, email threads, and manual approval chains with a centralized, real-time procurement platform — covering the complete cycle from vendor onboarding to invoice payment.

## Why PostgreSQL — Not Firebase or MongoDB

The entire procurement flow is built around **multi-step transactional logic** — every RFQ, quotation, approval, PO, and invoice is tightly linked and must stay consistent even if a step fails midway. This requires:

- **ACID transactions** — creating a PO auto-creates an invoice in the same transaction. If the invoice insert fails, the PO rolls back. No orphaned records.
- **Relational integrity** — foreign keys guarantee every quotation references a valid RFQ and vendor, every PO references an approved quotation, every invoice references a real PO.
- **Single source of truth** — approval status, PO status, and invoice status are never recomputed from history. They are updated atomically in place.
- **Complex joins** — the comparison view, approval chain, and dashboard stats all require multi-table joins that are trivial in PostgreSQL and painful in document stores.

## Database Design

```
users
  └── vendors (created_by → users.id)
  └── rfqs (created_by → users.id)
        └── rfq_line_items (rfq_id → rfqs.id)
        └── rfq_vendor_assignments (rfq_id → rfqs.id, vendor_id → vendors.id)
        └── rfq_attachments (rfq_id → rfqs.id)
  └── quotations (vendor_id → vendors.id, rfq_id → rfqs.id)
        └── quotation_line_items (quotation_id → quotations.id)
  └── approvals (quotation_id → quotations.id, rfq_id → rfqs.id, vendor_id → vendors.id)
        └── approval_steps (approval_id → approvals.id, approver_id → users.id)
  └── purchase_orders (approval_id → approvals.id, quotation_id → quotations.id)
  └── invoices (po_id → purchase_orders.id, vendor_id → vendors.id)
  └── activity_logs (performed_by → users.id)
```

### Key Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | UUID PK, role (admin / manager / procurement_officer / vendor), bcrypt hashed password |
| `vendors` | Master vendor registry — GST, category, status (active/pending/blocked), rating |
| `rfqs` | Request for Quotation header — auto-numbered RFQ-YYYY-NNNN, status flow |
| `rfq_line_items` | Line items per RFQ — item name, quantity, unit |
| `rfq_vendor_assignments` | Which vendors are invited to quote on which RFQ |
| `quotations` | Vendor quote — server-calculated subtotal, GST, grand total, auto-numbered QT-YYYY-NNNN |
| `quotation_line_items` | Per-item unit price, delivery days, total price |
| `approvals` | Approval workflow header — current step, overall status |
| `approval_steps` | L1 Review (manager) + L2 Approval (admin) with remarks and timestamps |
| `purchase_orders` | Auto-created on full approval — CGST/SGST split, auto-numbered PO-YYYY-NNNN |
| `invoices` | Auto-created alongside PO — due date, payment status, mark-paid |
| `activity_logs` | Audit trail for every action across all modules — JSONB metadata |

---

## Architecture — Backend Module Structure

Each feature is a self-contained module:

```
server/src/modules/
  auth/             → register, login, refresh token, logout
  users/            → get/update own profile
  vendors/          → vendor CRUD, status management, GST validation
  rfqs/             → RFQ creation with line items + vendor assignments, publish
  quotations/       → quote submission, server-side total calculation, submit flow
  approvals/        → initiate workflow, L1/L2 step approve/reject, auto-create PO
  purchase-orders/  → list and detail view, line items from approved quotation
  invoices/         → list, detail, mark-paid, PDF download, email via Nodemailer
  reports/          → dashboard stats, spending summary, vendor performance
  activity/         → paginated audit log with entity type filter
```

Every module follows the same pattern:

```
routes.js       → Express router, auth + role middleware chain
controller.js   → thin handler, calls DB directly, passes errors to next()
schema.js       → Zod validation schemas for all inputs
```

---

## Authentication Flow

- **Register** — first_name, last_name, email, password (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special char), role
- **Login** — bcrypt compare → issue JWT access token (15 min) + refresh token (7 days), both stateless JWTs
- **Every request** — Bearer token in Authorization header, verified by `auth` middleware → `req.user = { id, role }`
- **Role guard** — `requireRole('admin', 'manager')` middleware on sensitive routes
- **Token refresh** — Axios interceptor catches 401, calls `/auth/refresh`, retries original request silently
- **Security** — access token in Zustand memory only (never localStorage), rate limiter on auth routes (10 req / 15 min), bcrypt 12 rounds

### RFQ Status Flow

```
Draft ──► Published ──► Closed
  │                       │
  └──► Cancelled          └── (after PO generated)
```

### Quotation Status Flow

```
Draft ──► Submitted ──► Selected ──► (PO Generated)
                   └──► Rejected
```

### Approval Status Flow

```
Pending ──► Step 2 (L1 Manager) ──► Step 3 (L2 Admin) ──► Approved ──► PO Auto-Created
                    │                        │
                    └── Rejected             └── Rejected

```

### Invoice Status Flow

```
pending_payment ──► paid

### Auto-Number Reference Format

All documents are auto-numbered with year + zero-padded sequence:

```
RFQ-2026-0001   → Request for Quotation
QT-2026-0001    → Quotation
PO-2026-0001    → Purchase Order
INV-2026-0001   → Invoice
```

Format: `<PREFIX>-<YYYY>-<NNNN>` — resets per prefix per year, padded to 4 digits.

## Git Workflow

```
main      ← production ready, final hackathon submission
dev       ← active development branch
feature/* ← individual features merged into dev via PR
```

Commit convention used throughout:

```
feat(vendors): add GST validation and status filter
feat(approvals): auto-create PO on full approval
fix(quotations): server-side total rounding
chore(db): add index on activity_logs entity_type
docs(readme): add full API reference
refactor(auth): extract requireRole to separate middleware
```

---

## Security Highlights

- Passwords hashed with **bcrypt** (salt rounds 12) — plaintext never stored or logged
- JWT access token lives in **Zustand memory only** — never localStorage, never sessionStorage
- **Rate limiter** on auth routes — 10 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Helmet.js** security headers on all responses (XSS, CSRF, clickjacking protection)
- **CORS** restricted to `http://localhost:5173` only
- All inputs validated with **Zod** before any DB query runs
- Passwords never returned in any API response — explicitly excluded in every select
- **Role-based access** enforced server-side on every sensitive route — frontend role checks are UI-only
- SQL injection impossible — all queries use **Knex parameterized bindings**
- Approval step actions verify `req.user.id === step.approver_id` — cannot approve another user's step

---

## Key Design Decisions

**Why totals are calculated server-side**: Unit prices and quantities come from the client but grand totals, GST amounts, and subtotals are always computed on the server. This prevents price manipulation where a malicious client could submit a ₹0 grand total for a ₹2,50,000 order.

**Why PO and Invoice are auto-created**: Once an approval is fully approved there is no ambiguity — a PO must exist. Making it automatic inside the same database transaction as the final approval step ensures the system is never in an inconsistent state (approval approved but no PO).

**Why approval steps use a separate table**: Having `approval_steps` as rows (not columns on `approvals`) means the number of steps can change without a schema migration, each step has its own timestamps and remarks, and querying "which approvals need my action" is a simple `WHERE approver_id = ? AND status = 'pending'`.

**Why activity logs use JSONB metadata**: Different actions have different context — a vendor status change logs old and new status, a PO creation logs PO number and amount, a quotation submission logs grand total. JSONB lets each log entry carry whatever metadata is relevant without requiring separate columns for every event type.
